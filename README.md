# JavaScript Randomized Message Generator

The objective of this project was to build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program.

This app generates three types of challenges for the user:
1. A weekend challenge
2. A healthy food challenge
3. A kind deed challenge

Some functions that generate random integers were created in order to choose a challenge in each category as well as to modify certain challenges. 

Give it a shot!
